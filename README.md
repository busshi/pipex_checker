PIPEX CHECKER

Test your own pipex programm.... Run random commands to check with the original output. Mandatory part only!

Clone this repository in the root path of your pipex project :

git clone https://github.com/busshi/pipex_checker.git && cd pipex_checker && bash pipex_checker.sh



Usage : bash pipex_checker.sh


Note : you can edit the PIPEX_DIR variable in the script in you want to clone it elsewhere...


NOTE : This is not my best checker... It only check random commands... I advice you to find another checker for this project ;)
